# Grating Diffraction and Deep Learning Assisted Single-Exposure Super-Resolution Microscopy

## Abstract

&emsp;&emsp;In this work, we study a super-resolution single exposure microscopy technique based on the assistance of the near-field grating diffraction and deep learning. The one dimensional diffraction grating positioned between a sample and the objective lens of an optical microscope shifts the evanescent waves in the near-field region of the sample into the detection window, and deep learning models reconstruct the sample. We experimentally demonstrate that the grating diffraction enhances both the brightness and resolution of the images directly observed under the microscope as more high frequency information of the samples can be captured by the microscope. Moreover, the high-frequency information of the sample is helpful for the restoration the sample. Compared with the restored image without grating assistance, the restored image with grating assistance shows a higher degree of consistency with the original sample. The imaging resolution is affected by both the illumination wavelength λ and the grating period d. A smaller d and a shorter λ result in a higher resolution. As a result, the 115-nm-wide spacing in the sample with a resolution of λ/3.6 can be resolved when d=300 nm and λ=410 nm. We provide a new approach to realize super-resolution using a traditional optical microscope in a single-exposure.
